# DSDX Knitting Pattern

This knitting pattern is a submission for the [Data Science By Design Anthology](http://datasciencebydesign.org/grants). The pattern is designed to visceralize how often mothers still die in childbirth around the world and is based on data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality). 

The original pattern assumes a knitting speed of 20 stitches per minute. However, if you are a faster or slower knitter, you can personalize the pattern based on your own knitting speed. This will give you a knitting experience that will more closely match the rate of maternal deaths reflected in the pattern.

In the knitting.Rmd file, you can change the `stitch_rate` variable to reflect the number of stitches you knit per minute on average.
